    "description": "The core of the MathJax project is the development of its state-of-the-art, open source, JavaScript platform for display of mathematics. Our key design goals are:\n\nHigh-quality display of mathematics notation in all browsers.\nNo special browser setup required.\nSupport for LaTeX, MathML, and other equation markup directly in the HTML source.\nAn extensible, modular design with a rich API for easy integration into web applications.\nSupport for accessibility, copy and paste, and other rich functionality.\nInteroperability with other applications and math-aware search.\nSupport for equation conversion outside a browser (e.g., preprocessing on a server).\n\n\ndocs over on: https://www.mathjax.org/\nAny issues shoot an email to clasicwebtools [@] gmail.com",
